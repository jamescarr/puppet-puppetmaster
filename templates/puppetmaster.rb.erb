# This is small wrapper script that allows Upstart to more easily
# manage Puppet running under Unicorn. Due to Unicorn's forking
# behavior, Upstart can't know which pid to track after the master
# re-exec's itself.
#
# This script simply polls the Unicorn's pid file and passes known
# signals through to the master. When the pid file disappears, we
# assume Unicorn has finished and exit.
#
# Also, note that setting $0 to "puppet master" lets the logrotate
# configuration that ships with the Puppet packages HUP Unicorn's
# master correctly. It uses: pgrep -u puppet -f 'puppet master'

$0 = "puppet master"
